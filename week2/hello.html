<p><b>Bio:</b><br />
My name is Zhuoli Xu. I am a Chinese, born in May 8, 1991. I took all the pre-college education in China and came to MSU in Fall, 2009. In the first two years here, I chose computer science as my major, because I think that was my passion in my life. However, to be honest, learning this is tough for me. Therefore, basically the first two years I barely take time attending social activity. Everyday I just repeated the same life: waking up, programming, eating, sleeping, playing some video games. At the beginning of junior year, I decided to change my major to telecommunication, which share many same areas with computer science but much easier. I soon found that web development is my new passion. I found a job in MSU's museum, managin its website and dealing some IT cousulting. I started to attend some parties, play basketball, meet new people. I love my life and be willing to struggle for a better one.</p><br /> <br />

<p><b>Critique:</b><br />
The home page tries to make the website clean, neat and simple, so there are only some big icons listing here. However, though it looks clear, it does not look good on screen, because it lacks of balance, especially for those users with low-resolution monitors. Another bad thing here is, users did not know what these icons stand for. They do not even know if they be clicked or not. Not like a "house" icon, we all know it stands for home page. I suggested to use the traditional navigation bar to replace this.<br /><br />
Another thing this website should change is its stupid sloagan, like "We make super nice apps", "The best usenet browser in the world", "A very nice SSH client", etc. Yes indeed you need to market yourself, but not this way. Think about your users. Does my mom need to use SSH client? Does my accounting major girlfriend know what FTP is? User are professional, or to be prfessional. Just remove those baroque words and list their basic functions, and add a "more" button to let users want to enter in.
