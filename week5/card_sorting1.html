Why use Foldableme <br />

Process? <br />
First, I went through all the links inside foldable.me. Then I came up with some categories, and then wrote the name of each of the main items on an index card. Then, I shuffled the cards and give the deck to two users (my roomates). Then I ask each user to sort the cards into piles, placing items that belong together in the same pile. They can make as many or as few piles as they want; some piles can be big, others small. My dota varies from other particants because I used a online card sorting tool to simulate them.
