I want to build a more complete personal site. There will be pictures and videos on this site and organized well like in a professional webiste.
I would first let my navigation more interactive. Then I would sort my pictures more reasonable. According to my friends' appealing. Using something like "timeline" seems welcome.

Process:
Search some personal websites online and choose the favorite styles. Pick something like best and re-unite those elements in head.
