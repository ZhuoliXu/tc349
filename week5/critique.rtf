\f0\fs24 \cf0 This website looks concise. The UI design is interesting and can draw people's attention especially they first visited this website. For example, when you scrolled down or up, the images on this site will animate a little bit. This let u feel in a scientific movie and proficient in data analysis. The introduction is easy to follow. Those text's front size is just the size to read and the pictures were vivid to understand.\

I would suggest that the website do something following to do let this site look better. First, hide "30 day trial" in the home page. Some users may be scared off if they read the information, which requires money. You could put this button at the bottom as they finish reading the instruction, or, simply, change the button text to "register", because for those people who decide to register, they would not care the money thing.}
