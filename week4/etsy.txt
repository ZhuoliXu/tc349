This website has a obvious confusing thing on its homepage that it has two "Register" buttons and they are even close to each other. Although one is called "registry" and the other is called "register", I still could not know what each means differently from the other after.

Another big issue is, or maybe because I am not a girl so I am not sensitive to these, that I do not see the differences among its categories. The definition of each classification is so blur. For example, when I clicked into the "Vintage", I saw that I could buy bowls in there. However, why not belong to "Home & Living"? Also, I know the creator of this website tried to let the website be beautiful, so he/she put "handpick items" on home page. However, where comes this category? I could not find this on the left side bar.
