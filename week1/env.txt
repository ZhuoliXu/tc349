I am using the TextWrangler as my environment. I was thiniing to use Dreamweaver, because it is a famous software.
However, I found it was so expensive (as Adobe always been). Therefore, I started to look for a free and Mac running
software. One of my friends suggested me using TextWrangler. I easily found it on App Store and it was free. When I opened
it, it just appeared clean and looked like an advanced "Notebook". I am a starter of HTML, so I do not want to the software being 
complicated. TextWrangler is such a software.
