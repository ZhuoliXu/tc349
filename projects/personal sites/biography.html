<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Zhuoli Xu. I am a Chinese, born in May 8, 1991. I took all the pre-college education in China and came to MSU in Fall, 2009. In the first two years here, I chose computer science as my major, because I think that was my passion in my life. However, to be honest, learning this is tough for me. Therefore, basically the first two years I barely take time attending social activity. Everyday I just repeated the same life: waking up, programming, eating, sleeping, playing some video games.</td>
<td> At the beginning of junior year, I decided to change my major to telecommunication, which share many same areas with computer science but much easier. I soon found that web development is my new passion. I found a job in MSU's museum, managin its website and dealing some IT cousulting. I started to attend some parties, play basketball, meet new people. I love my life and be willing to struggle for a better one.</td>
