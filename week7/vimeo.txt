The design of Vimeo is concise. Users may register an account on this website as they get into the website at the first time, due the huge register box on the home page. The function of this website is easy to follow as they scroll down the page. However, there are a few things needed to be improve on this website.

First, the very first look, is cut into an incomplete piece. We see a half screen video down the register box. This is really annoying. Moreover, what do you mean by "watch the video we love"? As a user, they may want to know what is this website's job and difference between YouTube, which were listed below. Also, the creator wanted to make this website unique. However, the fonts on this website were quite common, or, we could say, they are using the default fonts.
