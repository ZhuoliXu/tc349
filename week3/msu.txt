The first biggest issue on MSU home page is that there are too many buttons in the navigation menu. "About", "Admission", "Academics", "Research", "Global", these are understandable. However, what do "engagement" and "athletics" mean? Students in MSU may get them quickly when they move their mouses on them, but how about those people who were high school students or parents know? Especially they were in other countries. A home page is the first look of your website, just try to be concise and clean. I suggested remove "Global" also.

On the other hand, this is a home page for a school, where a place to study, (even it's MSU). I did not see any "academics" here obviously (except the caption in the navigation bar). If I did not know MSU is a school, I may think it as a found raiser organization website. Do not just show those "Spartan" things in the slide show. Show some engineering or science professors' work. Also, you could show some plain college life on the home page. As a senior in MSU, I did not even know what are those slideshow pictures talking about.
