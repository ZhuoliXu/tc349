Facebook is the world-wide well-known social network website. Accessing Facebook using a mobile device is common in people's daily life. Basically, browsing Facebook on the cell phone is like using the mobile app "Instagram". Everything is just straight put on the page and all you need to do is scroll down. The "like", "comment" and "share" button is big and clear enough for you to press on. When you are checking your profile page, the layout looks just like its name "timeline".

However, the mobile page Facebook lack some of the features of the traditional ones. For example, search someone who you want to add does not always work (i'm using Android cell phone). Not like the web page one, you can easily find someone using many specific details. Another thing is that you cannot check which of your friends are online. That would cause some inconvenience in some situations.
