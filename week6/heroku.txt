This website's color makes users feel big pressure due to its dark color scale. However, it is not a big issue. I first thought it was a website about StarCraft II but obviously I was wrong. From the fonts to its symbols, the whole site displays a feeling of future world advanced technology. As a site running web development contents, the navigation bar was clear enough for developers to involve in.

However, some buttons on the home page is a little bit annoying. We could find "register now" on the top of the page and "sign up" at right corner. We could see a "How it works" on the home page, but remember, a new user came to a website will click less than 4 times. Why not put a video directly following? Moreover, showing your phone number on the home page looks stupid, just put an e-mail there or a feedback handout sheet.
