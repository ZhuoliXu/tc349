This website is pretty straight forward as e-commerce site. You can see different style t-shirts here and they all share the similar prices. When you scroll down the page you could always check your items by clicking the "cart" button at the right corner. The design of this website make you feel ease and relax, which highlights the theme of this website, not only business, but a colorful lifestyle. You could even see the stories of how the web site setting up. I have never seen such thing in any other websites, which is so innovative. 

Some obvious defects here would be that, when you scroll down the page, the right side of the page turns out to be blank. To fix this, the category menu on the right could follow with the page, which means always stays with the content the users are browsing. Another issue is that, the category on the navigation bar may not be that clear. Moreover, I did not know why there appear two logos on the left corner. For example, when I clicked "PIXELIVERY", the logo changes from an "U" to box.
