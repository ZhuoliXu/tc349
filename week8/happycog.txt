The website happy cog is a concise website, with straight introduction of how to use it. You can just scroll down the page and follow the instruction. Each step is clear and actually you can click on the navigation bar to jump into that step. This can not only let users check the progress they are actually in, but also can remove the "fear" of users. The fear of users is the new buttons of the page they first saw. They always do not want the website be too complex. 

Some improvements may be that it can put the sign in box a little bit up -- actually to the top is best. Also, the icon on the top on the left side seems useless. Users can click on it and nothing happened. If designers want to put an icon there, so just remove the link. Totally, the design is good and show atmoshpere of art with only a few colors.
